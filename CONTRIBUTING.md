# Contributors Guide

This guide is intended for _contributors_.

> A “contributor” could be anyone who comments on an issue or pull request, people who add value to the project
> (whether it’s triaging issues, writing code, or organizing events), or anybody with a merged pull request (perhaps
> the narrowest definition of a contributor).
